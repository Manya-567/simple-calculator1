**CALCULATOR1 – Web-Based Arithmetic Calculator**

A lightweight, client-side arithmetic calculator built with core web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Designed for educational use, this project demonstrates fundamental front-end development principles including semantic HTML structure, responsive styling, and dynamic DOM manipulation.

**Overview**

**Calculator1** provides a functional digital calculator interface capable of executing basic mathematical operations:

- Addition (+)  
- Subtraction (−)  
- Multiplication (×)  
- Division (÷)  

The application runs entirely in the browser with no external dependencies, making it ideal for learning, customization, or integration into larger beginner-friendly web projects.

**Running the Application**

1. Launch any modern web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, etc.).
2. Open the `index.html` file directly from the project folder:
   - Either by dragging the file into the browser window, or
   - Using the **File → Open File** menu option.
3. Interact with the calculator using mouse clicks or touch input.

No build tools, servers, or compilation steps are required.

**Technology Stack**

This project is built exclusively with native web technologies:

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure and accessibility foundation  
- **CSS3**: Custom styling with clean visual hierarchy and button feedback  
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Event-driven logic for input parsing, operation handling, and result display  

No frameworks, libraries, or package managers are used—ensuring simplicity and ease of understanding.

**Directory Structure**

```

│
├── index.html     # Primary document defining the calculator UI
├── style.css      # Stylesheet controlling layout, appearance, and responsiveness
├── script.js      # Core logic for arithmetic operations and user interaction
└── README.md      # Project documentation (this file)
```

Each file is modular and clearly commented to support readability and future enhancements.

**Potential Enhancements**

While currently focused on basic arithmetic, this project serves as a solid foundation for feature expansion, such as:

- Support for decimal and percentage calculations  
- Keyboard input compatibility  
- Expression history tracking  
- Scientific mode (trigonometry, logarithms, powers)  
- Theme toggling (light/dark mode)  
- Mobile-first responsive redesign  

These extensions offer excellent opportunities for practicing advanced JavaScript patterns and UI/UX improvements.
